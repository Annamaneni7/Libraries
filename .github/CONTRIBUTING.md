# How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this. This repository is maintained by the coding subsystem of team RoboManipal.<br>
We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:
- Arduino reference [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/), [website](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- Resources [here](https://playground.arduino.cc/main/resources)
- Git [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) and [cheatsheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

# Testing
All the libraries on the `master` branch are tested on the Arduino IDE by RoboManipal group. You can also test them personally, send us a 
proof of work and your library too will be on the master branch.

## Minimum requirements
- Documentation for all the libraries is mandatory, all the libraries must have a `README.md` file.
- All developers are suggested to read the [README](../README.md) file.
- It's suggested that you use appropriate naming conventions for all your identifiers.
